Welcome to my interests page! 

I am a part of Penn Chamber, where I play the piano. Last semester, I played in the Shumann piano quintet and I absolutely loved it.

I love music. I have been playing the piano since 4, and violin since 16, and now picking up cello! Obsessed with string instruments.

Beyond music, I also love travelling (about to go to Iceland), cooking, skiing, and learning languages (I am learning Japanese this semester).
