        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my interests page!</p>
<p>I am a part of Penn Chamber, where I play the piano. Last semester, I played in the Shumann piano quintet and I absolutely loved it.</p>
<p>I love music. I have been playing the piano since 4, and violin since 16, and now picking up cello! Obsessed with string instruments.</p>
<p>Beyond music, I also love travelling (about to go to Iceland), cooking, skiing, and learning languages (I am learning Japanese this semester).</p>
