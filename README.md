# hugo-kicking-the-tires

In this repository, I followed the instructions on the Chapter 1, "Kicking the Tires." My portfolio website contains several page:
1. About page 
2. Contact page 
3. Resume page
4. Interests page (which is my add on! More fun contents here: http://localhost:1313/interests/)

Note that since at the end of the chapter, we are asked to set the default archetype to be false, for all pages created using "hugo new name.md" command, 
they will be created with draft as false.
